### 1. Create Your Own Chatbot
![Demo 1](../static/images/1.png)
- **Description**: This demo allows you to create a chatbot using a URL of your choice. The system scrapes the provided URL, extracts data such as title and content, and converts the content into embeddings using OpenAI embedding. The data and embedding values are stored in a Vector Database, allowing you to chat with your own data.
- **Showcases**:
    - Scraping a URL and its child URLs.
    - Extracting data from web pages.
    - Converting content to embeddings.
    - Storing data in a Vector Database.
    - Chatting with your own data.
